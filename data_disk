When attaching a datadisk to an Azure VM running Ubuntu OS need to follow these instructions:

The disk is visible as /dev/sdc1
```sh
dmesg | grep SCSI
```
Format the disk
    sudo fdisk /dev/sdc1
Type
```sh
    n (new partition)
    p (primary)
    <enter> (1)
    <enter> (2048)
    <enter> (last sector)
p (create partition)
w (write partition)
```

    sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdd1
Create a temporary mount point and mount
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
$ sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt/tmp
$ mount | grep /sdc1
We will use this disk to mount as /home by default, so set that up
Check how much disk is used for /home
$ sudo du -sh /home
Synchronise /home to the new disk
$ sudo rsync -avzh /home/ /mnt/tmp/
Identify the unique identifier for the disk
$ sudo -i blkid | grep sdc1
Tell the system to mount the new disk as /home
$ sudo emacs /etc/fstab
Add the following single line with the appropriate UUID
UUID=f395b783-31da-4916-a3a9-8fb56fd7a068 /home ext4 defaults,nofail,discard 1 2
Now mount the new disk as /home
$ sudo mount /home
No longer need the temporary mount so unmount
$ sudo umount /mnt/tmp
Move to the new version of home and ensure ssh can access
$ cd ~
$ df -h .
$ sudo restorecon -r /home
